#Welcome to my Python page for Jupyter (IPython) notebooks.

These notebooks can be viewed as a webpage by pasting the github URL into nbviewer.jupyer.org

This notebook covers the basic examples of the Python Language and how to use Jupyter Notebooks:
[Python core types and loop examples](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/worker-bee-micah/practice-only/blob/master/00_mt_core_types_loops.ipynb)


For my current research into the Numerical Python (NumPy) module, check out this notebook:
[Numerical Python codebase](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/worker-bee-micah/practice-only/blob/master/00_mt_numpy_codebase.ipynb)


This notebook contains further coding experiments, especially with FOR an WHILE loops.
Generators and iterators can be constructed with these core examples.

[Functions and Test Loops with Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/worker-bee-micah/practice-only/blob/master/00_mt_py_functions_tests_loops.ipynb)

The coconuts, parrot_archive, Eye_of_Parrot and compressed_parrot_whizzo are outputs from unit tests.

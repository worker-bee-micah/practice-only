#Welcome to my Python page for Jupyter (IPython) notebooks.

These notebooks can be viewed as a webpage by pasting the github URL into nbviewer.jupyer.org

This notebook covers the basic examples of the Python Language and how to use Jupyter Notebooks:
[Python core types and loop examples](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/worker-bee-micah/practice-only/blob/master/00_mt_core_types_loops.ipynb)


For my current research into the Numerical Python (NumPy) module, check out this notebook:
[Numerical Python codebase](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/worker-bee-micah/practice-only/blob/master/00_mt_numpy_codebase.ipynb)


This notebook contains further coding experiments, especially with FOR an WHILE loops.
Generators and iterators can be constructed with these core examples.

The coconuts, parrot_archive, Eye_of_Parrot and compressed_parrot_whizzo are example outputs from unit tests. The programs DnD_dice.py and bridge_keeper.py are used for IF ELSE examples.


Two notebooks for building analysis applicatins with the *pandas* library, the first one covers the basics of creating common dataframes (tabular rows and columns) and series (a really long line).  The second example shows how to import a variety of files, do a simple transformation or two, then export to a variety of outputs.

The source code for this notebook came from a training module by {'author' : 'Janani Ravi', 'title' : 'Visualizing Statistical Data Using Seaborn', 'site' : 'pluralsight.com'}
This notebook contains basic examples for plotting columns after importing CSV files. e.g. a failed bank list, a TPS report, and bike path usage graph.

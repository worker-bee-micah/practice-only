Welcome to my Python page for Jupyter (IPython) notebooks.

These notebooks can be viewed as a webpage by pasting the github URL into nbviewer.jupyer.org

This notebook covers the basic examples of the Python Language and how to use Jupyter Notebooks:

For my current research into the Numerical Python (NumPy) module, check out this notebook:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/worker-bee-micah/practice-only/blob/master/00_mt_numpy_codebase.ipynb


This notebook contains further coding experiments, especially with FOR an WHILE loops.
Generators and iterators can be constructed with these core examples.
